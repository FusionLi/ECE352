Q1.1: General-purpose Callee-saved registers: r16-r23
      Frame pointer: r28 (When it is not used, it is availible for
callee-saved register)

Q1.2: r2, r3, r8-r15

Q1.3: sp: The stack pointer points to the last used slot, it is used to
allocate memory and trace the saved value of register on the stack.

Q1.4: The stack pointer points to the last used slot

Q1.5 ra register should be saved in caller function before call any function. It is used to save the
address of the calling instruction + 4

Q1.6: r4-r7

Q1.7: r2-r3

Q1.8: Saving r4 and r7 on stack can make these registers availible for general
use, which gives more freedom and less restriction for the program, which
simplified the algorithm. Also, when the function wants to call another
function, it does not need to worry about losing previous argument passed in.

Q2:	r4: the address of the string "OOOHHHDDD"
   	r5: argument 8
    	r6: argument 9
   	r7: argument 10
   	ra: the address of the instruction "printn" + 4 (after call
instruction) in this case
	
	0(sp): 11
	4(sp): 12
	8(sp): 13
	12(sp): 14
	16(sp): 15
	20(sp): 16
	24(sp): ra
	Frame pointer points to the address after ra

Q3: On sepearate files
