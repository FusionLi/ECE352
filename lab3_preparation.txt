Q1.1: General-purpose Callee-saved registers: r16-r23
      Frame pointer: r28 (When it is not used, it is availible for
callee-saved register)

Q1.2: r2-r15 might change because they could be changed by the callee functions

Q1.3: sp: The stack pointer points to the last used slot, it is used to
allocate memory and trace the saved value of register on the stack.

Q1.4: The stack pointer points to the last used slot (the most top data in the
stack)

Q1.5 ra register should be saved in caller function before call any function. It is used to save the address of the calling instruction + 4

Q1.6: r4-r7

Q1.7: r2-r3

Q1.8: Save r4 and r7 on stack so I can just find all arguments from the stack,
which means I do not need to worry about the arguments stored in r4-r7
seperately.

Q2:	r4: the address of the string "OOOHHHDDD" (0x2000)
   	r5: argument 8
    	r6: argument 9
   	r7: argument 10
   	ra: the address of the instruction "printn" + 4 (after call
instruction) in this case
	
	0(sp): 11
	4(sp): 12
	8(sp): 13
	12(sp): 14
	16(sp): 15
	20(sp): 16
	24(sp): sp (fp - 28)
	Frame pointer points to the address after 24(sp)

Q3: On sepearate files
