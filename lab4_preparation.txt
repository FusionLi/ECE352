Using GPIO JP1 0x10000060

2.1 0x07f557ff, 0x10000064 (Address GPIO JPI + 4)

2.2 4, 0x10000060, 0xffffffef (basically a 0 in bit 4 to enable it)

2.3.a  0xffffefff, 0x10000060, off

2.3.b 13, 0x10000060, 0

2.3.c 31, 27, 0x10000060

3.1 It counts downwards

3.2 Write Periodl (timer address + 8) and Periodh (timer address + 12)

3.3 Check bit 0 (Timeout bit in base address) to judge whether timer has timed
out

3.4 Read counter Snapshot (lower 16 bits) and counter Snaoshot (upper 16 bits)

3.5 Check Run bit in base address

4 Seperate fiels
